### Aim:  
We are using [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD#Overview) to better understand gene flow between three geographically distinct populations of king rail (_Rallus elegans_). One individual from each population will be compared using [ABBABABA(D-stat)](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Abbababa). Our presentation of our steps and findings is located in the PresentationSlides subdirectory.
