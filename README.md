## Applied Genomics Analysis is a graduate level course at East Carolina University


### Course objectives: 
*Applied Genomics Analysis focuses on the understanding and application of statistical 
genomics and bioinformatics through the lens of contemporary technologies and software. In this course, we gained a basic 
understanding of:*  

  1) *Genomics history and theory*
  2) *R coding for genomics*
  3) *Statistical genomics*
  4) *Exploratory machine learning*
  5) *Predictive modeling*
  6) *Working with genomics intervals*
  7) *Raw data QC/filtering/alignment*
  8) *RNS-seq analyses*
  9) *CHiP-seq analysis*
  10) *DNA methylation analysis*
  11) *Multi-omics analyses*
